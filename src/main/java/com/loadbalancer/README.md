This project implements a basic load balancer using Java.
It forwards incoming client requests to multiple backend servers to distribute load evenly.

The load balancer uses a round-robin strategy to choose the next available server.
It maintains a list of backend servers and routes requests sequentially.

This project helps in understanding:

How load balancers work internally

Request routing logic

Server selection strategies

Basic fault handling when a server is unavailable
